# Alfredo Pena
I am a Data Science major (GPA 3.8) with a strong background in linguistics and language teaching. I know SQL, Python, R and Statistical Analysis (machine learning, data programming & visualization, applied statistical modeling, object-oriented programming), with a great domain of Excel, Tableau, and Power BI. 

I am also a very self-sufficient learner completely fluent in Spanish, English, Portuguese, and Catalan, which facilitates working in diverse cultures and assuming leadership roles, as well as helping with oral and written communication.
